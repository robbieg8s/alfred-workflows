Improvements that have occurred to me:

## Atlassian

- Can you improve the type safety around displayDialog, specifically
  automatically inferring the `defaultAnswer`/`textReturned` correspondence, or
  the button names?

## Tooling

- Add a lint-workflow which checks package.json and info.plist are still sensibly in sync.
